## Commit Conventions
This project uses [release-please-action](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action), so commit conventions are required for
automated releases.

- Commit messages must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
- Husky and commitlint enforce the commit format locally.

## Merge Style
Squash merges are recommended to keep the history clean and release notes
predictable.
